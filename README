# United Lexicons Project

This repository contains lexical resources and a simple website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Local development

If you have Jekyll installed, you can build the site locally:

```sh
jekyll serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4000` in your browser.
